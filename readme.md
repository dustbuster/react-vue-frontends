Hello, all! This is an practice repo. I have a NUXT app with Vue, and a NEXT app with react, both are a work in progress. 
feel free to check them out. While i have some time on my hands, i feel that starting and configuring and developing on both vue and react are a great way to grow my skills and maybe show off a little of what i can build. 

Thanks all! 

Dustin
