## Welcome to my frontend bonanza!

**This include several frontends, that are more experimental than anything**

### There are several parts to this.

- I have a NUXT app with Vue 3 used for a coding demo. (vue-next)
- There's a NEXT app with React which is me flaining about. (first_next-react-app)
- There's a walk through tutorial with React. (react tutorial)
- There's a walk through tutorial with NEXT and React. (nextjs-react-tutorial)

Most of which are in progress.

Feel free to check them out. While i have some time on my hands, i feel that starting and configuring and developing on both Vue and React JS are a great way to grow my skills.

Thanks all!
